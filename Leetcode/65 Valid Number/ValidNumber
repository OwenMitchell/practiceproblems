# Write a program to decide if a given string is a valid number by the following rules.

A number is either a integer or a decmial number with or without an e (or E) followed by a integer, scientific notation (e -> x10^).
The number can also be signed (+/-), but chaining signs should not be accepted as a valid number. (no -- or +- ect)

For example, all the following are valid numbers: ["2", "0089", "-0.1", "+3.14", "4.", "-.9", "2e10", "-90E3", "3e+7", "+6e-1", "53.5e93", "-123.456e789"], while the following are not valid numbers: ["abc", "1a", "1e", "e3", "99e2.5", "--6", "-+3", "95a54e53"].
